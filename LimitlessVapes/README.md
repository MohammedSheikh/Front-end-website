# Front End Web Application

## 1. Introduction

The web application that is being created will be introduced as an e-commerce site, selling products and services that involve vape flavours and E-Cigarette Box Mods. There will be various offers for the customer to choose from, however as this will be an inital prototype of the actual web application, a restriction on offers will be set.

## 2. Motivation

The idea for developing a website that involves e-liquid and E-Cigarette Mods came from a business plan that was introduced last year by me and my partner. We identified a gap in the market that suggested more and more people were moving towards smoking vape, and seen this as a fine alternative to cigarettes and shisha and tobaco.

Our scope originally targeted the cigarette smoking industry, as vape liquids also come with nicotine coated flavours, however but with a lot less nicotine which slowly allow the customer to quit smoking and start vaping full time. This was the original idea however we thought the shisha market was slowly becoming saturated, so we decided to aim at these users too, as it is an easier and cheaper alternative to shisha, with less hastle. 

As the business has now been running for a year, a website would allow our business to develop further wihtin the vaping industry. 

## 3. Designs

The designs involved the creation of wireframes for the website, to gain a feel of how the website should look to the end user.

1. Desktop Application Designs
2. Mobile Designs
3. Tablet Designs

### 3.a Feature Designs

1. Single Page Application (SPA) - The site is an SPA which allows the user to browse through the web application without being reloaded to a new page.

2. The Navigation bar - This is positioned at the top and as the user scrolls to the next **section**, it is transitioned in through an animation. The navigation bar thereafter becomes fixed at the top throughout the rest of the site, however when the end user reaches the first **section**, it dissapears and is seen again when the user scrolls to the top of the page.

3. Navigation/other buttons - These contain links to diffrent parts of the sectiion, as the user clicks on these, they are scrolled through the appropriate section, this feature is set through Jquery.

4. CSS styles - Hovering over certain images brings out a cool zoom in zoom out finish. The colour of the images also change upon hovering over the images. This is achieved  through pure css styling.

5. Validation - The contact form is situated at the bottom of the site. This is validated so if the user submits without appropriate information, they are notified to input details again.

6. Social media icons - These icons are contained within the footer at the bottom of the site. Upon hovering over these items, a cool effect is generated where the icons change in colour.

## 4. Testing Application


1. All navigation buttons should be functional, and be taken to the appropriate pages.
2. Animations should work correctly.
3. Website should be responsive to other devices.
4. Website should be responsive on browsers such as Google Chrome, mozilla firefox, Opera and Microsoft Edge.

## 5. Results

1. Are Navigation buttons functional and work correctly? Yes.
2. Do Animations work correctly? Yes.
3. Is website responsive to other devices? Yes, responsive on devices such as mobile phones and tablets.
4. Is website responsive on other browsers? Yes.

## 6. PARC Design

There are four principles that all visual deaign should include:

1. Proximity: Items should be grouped together to create organisation.
2. Alignment: Items should have a visual connection with something else on the page.
3. Repetition: A consistent look and feel to a page should be presented to the end user.
4. Contrast: A contrast of bigger fonts to smaller fonts. Font weight, colour and diffrent image sizes.

## 7. conclusion

I believe a lot of the fundamentals that have been covered for front end web design has become a lot clear for me to understand and apply to real life projects. These fundamentals have allowed me to understand how the core front end web technologies HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript are interlinked to create powerful web applications, and the experiences I have gained from this module will encourage me to take on big projects in the future for clientele.
