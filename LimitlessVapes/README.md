# Front End Web Application

## 1. Introduction

The web application that is being created will be introduced as an e-commerce site, selling products and services that involve vape flavours and E-Cigarette Box Mods. There will be various offers for the customer to choose from, however as this will be an inital prototype of the actual web application, a restriction on offers will be set.

## 2. Motivation

The idea for developing a website that involves e-liquid and E-Cigarette Mods came from a business plan that was introduced last year by me and my partner. We identified a gap in the market that suggested more and more people were moving towards smoking vape, and seen this as a fine alternative to cigarettes and shisha and tobaco.

Our scope originally targeted the cigarette smoking industry, as vape liquids also come with nicotine coated flavours, however but with a lot less nicotine which slowly allow the customer to quit smoking and start vaping full time. This was the original idea however we thought the shisha market was slowly becoming saturated, so we decided to aim at these users too, as it is an easier and cheaper alternative to shisha, with less hastle. 

As the business has now been running for a year, a website would allow our business to develop further wihtin the vaping industry.
